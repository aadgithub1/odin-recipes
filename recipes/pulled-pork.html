        This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's easy to make in the slow cooker. I like to serve the shredded pork on toasted buttered rolls. My family's favorite!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker.</li>
        <li><strong>Pork: </strong>If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.  .</li>
        <li><strong>Sauces: </strong>You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple cider vinegar: </strong>Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors. </li>
        <li><strong>Broth: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</li>
    </ul>
